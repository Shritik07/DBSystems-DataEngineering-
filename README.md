PRODUCT SHIPPING ANALYSIS

Context:

We look to access an example MongoDB Database - the ProductOrderdatabase. The ProductOrder database maintains an inventory of TV products ofvarious brands and models. 
It allows users to place orders for one or more of these items, and offers discounts on these purchases.
In the ProductOrder database, there are mainly four categories of information:
● Product information
● Inventory information
● User information
● Order information

Objective:

Having all this information in place we need to create a Database called ProductOrder and various collections in it. The collections needed and attributes which need 
to be in every collection are given by the Organization. All you have to do is create collections with data in it and write some queries sothat the organization can
retrieve required information.

Files Provided:

The resources that have been shared with you as part of the zipped JSON docs folder, there are 4 main files.
Product_info.json, Inventory_info.json, User_info.json, and Order_info.json
The JSON files that contain the information to be inserted into the database.


Part 2-

Objective:

Visualizing high dimensional data using PCA and doing dimensionality reduction to check the explained variance using the PCA model. Training a
Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) model to check if the product has been shipped or canceled.

Problem Statement:

XYZ.com is an e-commerce company based in Argentina. Due to the covid crisis and lockdown XYZ.com is facing lots of issues from the dealer and the
shipment team. XYZ.com has lots of product data where various shipping and sales details of each product have been mentioned. XYZ.com wants to find out
which of the products has been shipped and which of the products has been canceled to reduce customer escalation. As a data-scientist, we have to train a
PCA model to visualize its higher-dimensional data and we have to train an LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis) model to predict which of the products has
been shipped and which of the products has been canceled.
